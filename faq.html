            <b>&ensp;Q: Are dual enrollment college transcripts required for freshman admission?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: If you completed dual enrollment coursework while in high school, official copies of your college transcripts(s) are not required at the time of application or for an admission decision. Upon graduation from high school, official final transcripts from all post-secondary institutions showing grades for dual enrollment coursework will be due to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
            <br><br><b>&ensp;Q: Do you consider weighted GPAs?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: Grades in Advanced Placement, AICE, dual enrollment, honors and International Baccalaureate courses will be given additional weight in your GPA computation if the courses are considered academic core
            <br><br><b>&ensp;Q: How do high school seniors apply for UCF scholarships?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: There is no separate application for UCF scholarships. All freshman applicants offered admission are considered for these awards so long as funds are available.
            <br><br><b>&ensp;Q: Where can I apply for hosuing?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: Housing applications are available for freshmen after they are offered admission, however, the timing depends on several factors.
            <br><br><b>&ensp;Q: Where else can I go to research freshman scholarships?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: There are a variety of options for scholarships.

            Your high school guidance or college counseling office,
            UCF’s Office of Student Financial Assistance website,
            and Online sites like Fastweb and CollegeBoard.
            <br><br><b>&ensp;Q: Do I have to register for a tour?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: Yes, each student must register to attend a campus event, though parents and other family members can register as guests under one student’s name. We want to make certain that everyone gets the attention they need, and fewer people means more one-on-one attention for you, so we limit space.
            <br><br><b>&ensp;Q: Ok, I’m registered for an Open House. Where do I go and when?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: Once you get to the main campus, park in Garage A (free of charge), then walk to the Student Union — there will be signs in place to help you find your way. Once inside, go to the Pegasus Ballroom. Our campus is a walking campus, so there is no transportation between the garage and the Student Union. Consult your confirmation for the event’s start time and arrive early to avoid waiting in line.
            <br><br><b>&ensp;Q:What is the Student Union?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: Known as the “heart of campus,” the Student Union sits at the center of UCF’s main Campus. The Student Union provides space for students and members of the UCF community to study, socialize, eat, host events, attend meetings and engage in campus life.
            <br><br><b>&ensp;Q:How many clubs and organizations are there at UCF?</b><br><br>&ensp;A: There are over 650 student clubs and organizations you can get involved in.
            <br><br>&ensp;Also any questions or information that you may have or need, please download the UCF mobile app which will assist you in many ways.
